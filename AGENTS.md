# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (Copilot, Claude Code, and similar) working in this
repository. Humans should read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) instead.

## Project overview

`drpangloss` fits interferometric (AMI/OIFITS) data with JAX- and zodiax-based models.
Library code lives in `src/drpangloss/`, tutorials in `notebooks/`, reusable end-to-end
scripts in `examples/`, and tests in `tests/`.

## Setup

```bash
uv python install 3.11
uv venv --python 3.11 .venv
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
```

Cloud agents get this environment from `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`.

## Definition of done

Before committing:

1. `bash scripts/lint_local.sh --fix`
2. `uv run --python .venv/bin/python pytest`
3. If you touched a tutorial notebook: rerun `scripts/sync_tutorial_docs.py` and
   `pytest tests/test_tutorial_docs_sync.py`.
4. If you touched docstrings or `docs/`: `mkdocs build --strict`.

CI also autofixes formatting on same-repo PRs (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`), but do not
rely on it — a clean diff keeps review focused on the actual change.

## Conventions

- Ruff is pinned to **0.11.0**; `[tool.ruff] required-version`, the `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  rev, and `RUFF_VERSION` in the workflows must always match. A different ruff version will
  reformat files differently and fail CI.
- Line length 79, double quotes, rules `E` + `F` (see `pyproject.toml` for ignores).
- drpangloss does not enable float64: library code must work in JAX's default float32
  (e.g. use `jnp.finfo(x.dtype)`, not `np.finfo(float)`). Tests run in float32 unless
  they opt in locally with `with jax.enable_x64(True):` (as `tests/test_utils.py` does);
  never set `jax_enable_x64` globally at import time in a test module.
  Forward-model code must pass in both float32 and float64. Fourier transforms and
  matmuls over pixels use `precision=jax.lax.Precision.HIGHEST`, since on A100/H100
  GPUs the default is TF32 (~1e-3 relative error). Fitting entry points (`fit`) default
  to float64 inside a local `jax.enable_x64(True)` context (`_precision.run_in` and
  `cast_tree`), with float32 as an option.
- Every likelihood, grid, limit and fit uses one residual vector,
  `likelihood.whitened_residuals` (unprojected phases as the chord 2 sin(Δ/2)/σ,
  a von Mises likelihood). Do not recompute χ² from `OIData.residuals`, which is for
  display.
- `OIData.model` calls `model_on_grid` when the data carry a `uv_grid` (a regular uv
  lattice, e.g. AMIGO DISCOs); it defaults to `model`. A model that overrides
  `model_on_grid` must return exactly what `model` would, only faster.
- New model code goes in `src/drpangloss/models.py`.
- Bessel functions come from [jaxbessel](https://github.com/benjaminpope/jaxbessel),
  shared with harmonix; fix or extend them there, not in drpangloss.
- Old exploratory notebooks live in `notebooks/archive/`, which is git-ignored
  and unmaintained: do not read, edit, lint or cite them.

Imports flow one way: `_utils`/`_geometry`/`_precision` → `oifits`/`amigo`/`oidata`
→ `models` → `likelihood` → `fitting` → `imaging`, and `likelihood` → `inference` → `_grid` →
(`grid_fit`, `limits`) → `plotting`. `grid_fit` and `limits` do not import each other;
`scenes` imports only `_geometry` and `_utils`.

## Flux and contrast

`flux` always means a flux *relative to the primary* (companion/primary, so
0.01 for a companion 100 times fainter). Reports and plots follow the
astronomical convention instead: **contrast** is primary/companion (100) and
**Δmag** is `2.5 log10(contrast)` (5 mag). Convert with
`drpangloss.limits.flux_to_contrast` / `flux_to_delta_mag`, and plot with
`units="flux" | "contrast" | "delta_mag"`. Never name a model parameter
`contrast`.

## Image coordinate convention

**This convention must never be violated.** It has been the direct cause of real
bugs (see below), and any new coordinate, rendering, or plotting code must be
verified against it with a direct orientation test — not just a
finiteness/normalization check.

- Rendered images and `(dra, ddec)` grids are 2D arrays using standard array
  indexing: the first index (row) runs top-to-bottom, the second index (column)
  runs left-to-right. That part is generic.
- The **physical sky coordinates** assigned to those array positions follow
  astronomical convention, not a generic image convention: **East points left,
  North points up**.
  - `x` (a right-ascension-like offset, e.g. `dra`) **increases to the left**
    (East is positive `x`).
  - `y` (a declination-like offset, e.g. `ddec`) **increases upward** (North
    is positive `y`).
  - Consequently: as the **row index increases, `y` decreases** (row 0 =
    North, the top row). As the **column index increases, `x` decreases**
    (column 0 = East, the leftmost column).
- The coordinate origin `(x, y) = (0, 0)` sits at the **geometric center of
  the pixel grid** — the center of the center pixel(s), not a pixel edge.
- **Position angles** (binary separations, an ellipse's projected major axis,
  azimuthal modulation phases) are measured **counter-clockwise from the top**,
  i.e. **North-to-East**: PA=0° points North, PA=90° points East.

The canonical, tested reference implementation is `image_coordinates` in
`src/drpangloss/_geometry.py` (image-plane pixel coordinates) and the elliptical
rotation/stretch helpers in the same module (`undo_`/`apply_elliptical_transf_coord`
and `..._spat_freq`). Every geometric `SourceModel`'s `model()`/`render()` must
be dimensionally consistent with these, and should have a direct regression
test analogous to `test_gaussian_disk_render_uses_interferometric_image_orientation`,
`test_uniform_disk_render_uses_interferometric_image_orientation`, or
`test_modulated_gaussian_rim_render_follows_north_to_east_pa_convention` in
`tests/test_models_sources.py` — i.e. one that asserts flux/argmax lands at the
*correct* pixel for a known offset or PA, not just that the output is finite.

**Plotting rule:** any `imshow`-based display of a sky-coordinate image or grid
must end up with the x-axis increasing toward the left (East) and the y-axis
increasing toward the top (North) *regardless of how the underlying
array/extent/origin was constructed*. Do not assume a particular `dra`/`ddec`
axis ordering (ascending vs. descending) — different parts of this codebase
build these axes both ways. Use `_enforce_sky_orientation` in
`src/drpangloss/plotting.py`, which corrects an `Axes`' final displayed limits
regardless of the plotted array's construction, rather than hand-tuning
`origin`/`extent` per call site.

Historical motivation: this exact convention was violated in three independent
places found in one audit — `BinaryModelAngular`'s position angle was mirrored
about the North-South axis (a real bug in `model()`/`render()`, not just
display); `notebooks/source_models.ipynb`'s render plots used `origin="lower"`
with a non-reversed extent; and two of `plotting.py`'s five grid-plotting
functions displayed `dra` backwards. None of these were caught by existing
tests because none of them asserted orientation directly — see
`add_modulated_gaussian_rim_and_uniform_disk`'s commit history for the fixes.

Every model's `render()` must also be consistent with its `model()`: the
Fourier transform of the rendered image must reproduce the visibilities
(`test_render_fourier_transform_matches_model_visibilities`). Add new models
to that test.

## Model composition

- There are two kinds of `SourceModel`. **Components** (`Component`
  subclasses: `PointSource`, `GaussianDisk`, `UniformDisk`,
  `ModulatedGaussianRim`) are pure shapes normalized to unit flux, with
  `flux`, `dra`, `ddec`; their `flux` is a relative weight. **Scenes**
  (`System`, the binaries, `HarmonixModel`) are whole normalized skies with
  weight 1 inside a `System`, unless they carry their own `flux` weight as
  `System` does.
- `flux` means a relative weight. The binaries' companion/primary `flux` (and
  `contrast`) is a legacy exception; no new model may use `flux` as a ratio.
- Components never contain a built-in star; compose one with
  `System(star=PointSource(), ...)`. New shapes subclass `Component` and
  implement `_centred_cvis` and `_centred_image`. Anything that can be drawn
  implements `_image`; `SourceModel.render` handles the grid and
  normalization.
- `System(**named)` mixes components as `sum(f_i V_i) / sum(f_i)`. Only flux
  ratios are identifiable: keep one reference component (usually the star) at
  `flux=1`. Components are stored as ordered tuples (`names` is static), so
  their order survives pytree operations. Names must be identifiers that do
  not clash with `System` attributes.
- There is deliberately no `+`/`*` operator sugar: parameter paths are the
  public fitting interface and must depend only on the names the user chose.
- Parameters are addressed by zodiax dot-paths through component names
  (`"comp.flux"`); tools accept a template model plus paths anywhere they
  accept a model class (`build_model`). The argument is called `model`.
- Grid tools that optimize a flux (`optimized_likelihood_grid`,
  `optimized_flux_grid`, `laplace_flux_uncertainty_grid`, `absil_limits`)
  use the one key whose last part is `flux` (`_utils.resolve_flux_param`);
  if there is none or more than one, the caller must pass `flux_param=`.
  Plotting uses the same rule.
- Fluxes are non-negative. `Component`/`System` reject concrete negative
  fluxes in `__check_init__` (traced values cannot be checked),
  `numpyro_model` rejects flux priors with negative support, and grid tools
  reject negative flux axes. The optimizers in `optimized_flux_grid`
  deliberately stay unconstrained, because Ruffio upper limits need the
  unconstrained estimate.
- `SourceModel._weight(wavel)` takes the wavelength (or `None` for the
  reference flux, e.g. when rendering), so chromatic fluxes can be added
  without changing every subclass.
- To fit derived or tied parameters, pass a function returning a model
  wherever a template is accepted (`build_model`, `numpyro_model`,
  `laplace_cov`, grid tools). Positions are tied by nesting.
- Grid tools are `eqx.filter_jit`-compiled with the template's arrays
  **traced**, so new parameter values never recompile and JAX's persistent
  compilation cache can hit across sessions. Do not reintroduce static
  templates or value-dependent code paths (e.g. skipping work when a value
  is a known zero): they bake constants into the HLO, which recompiles for
  every value and defeats the persistent cache.
- `BinaryModelCartesian`/`BinaryModelAngular` stay dedicated classes — the
  core binary-fitting path must not change or slow down. `to_system()` gives
  the equivalent `System` for extension and rendering.

## Do not modify

- `site/` — committed build output, regenerated by the docs tooling.
- `docs/generated/` and `data/*.npy` — generated or fixture data.
- `docs/*.md` pages listed in `scripts/sync_tutorial_docs.py::MAPPINGS` — generated from
  notebooks (see below).
- `notebooks/archive/` — old exploratory notebooks, git-ignored; do not read or edit.
- `.venv/`, `.lint-logs/`.

## Notebooks and docs are coupled

The notebooks listed in `MAPPINGS` in `scripts/sync_tutorial_docs.py` are the source of
truth for the corresponding `docs/*.md` pages. Edit the notebook, execute it so outputs
are current (the sync embeds text and PNG outputs), then run the sync script.
`tests/test_tutorial_docs_sync.py` fails if the markdown is stale.

## Testing notes

`pytest` is preconfigured with `-q` and `testpaths = ["tests"]`. The JAX suites are slow to
warm up, so iterate with a single test id and run the full suite once at the end.

## Pull requests

- Keep diffs small and focused on the request.
- Do not commit notebook output churn unrelated to your change.
- Do not add runtime dependencies to `[project].dependencies` without asking.
- Never use `--no-verify`, never rewrite published history, never commit secrets.
