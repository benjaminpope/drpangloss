# Conventions

This page collects the conventions virgil uses: which way the axes point, what sign a phase has, what a flux means, and so on. None of them is hard, but they are the places where two reasonable people disagree, and where a wrong guess flips a binary by 180° without any error message. The API pages document each function; this page explains the choices behind them. Every statement here has been checked against the code, and the tests named below fail if one of them changes.

## Sky coordinates and images

Positions on the sky are offsets from a reference point, in milliarcseconds:

- `dra` is the right-ascension-like offset, **positive to the East**;
- `ddec` is the declination-like offset, **positive to the North**.

Because East is on the left of a sky image, `dra` increases to the *left*. This is the usual astronomer's picture of the sky, not the usual picture of a graph.

**Position angle** (PA) is measured from North through East, in degrees: PA 0° is North, 90° is East, 180° is South and 270° is West. It is counter-clockwise on a sky image with North up and East left. A companion at separation $s$ and position angle $\theta$ has

$$
\mathrm{dra} = s \sin\theta, \qquad \mathrm{ddec} = s \cos\theta,
$$

which is how [`BinaryModelAngular`][virgil.models.BinaryModelAngular] relates to [`BinaryModelCartesian`][virgil.models.BinaryModelCartesian]. Going the other way, $\theta = \operatorname{arctan2}(\mathrm{dra}, \mathrm{ddec})$ (note the order of the arguments), taken modulo 360°. All other angles that are position angles, such as the orientation of an ellipse's major axis or the phase of an azimuthal modulation, follow the same rule.

### Images

Rendered images and `(dra, ddec)` grids are ordinary 2D arrays: the first index is the row and runs from the top of the picture to the bottom, the second is the column and runs left to right. The sky coordinates attached to them are:

| Array index | Direction on the sky | Coordinate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| row 0 | top, North | largest `ddec` |
| row increases | downwards, towards South | `ddec` decreases |
| column 0 | left, East | largest `dra` |
| column increases | rightwards, towards West | `dra` decreases |

The origin `(0, 0)` is at the *centre of the centre pixel* (for an even number of pixels, the corner shared by the four central pixels), at index $(n-1)/2$ along each axis. A pixel's offset along one axis is $((n-1)/2 - \mathrm{index})\,h$ for pixel size $h$ in mas. Both `image_coordinates` and [`pixel_offsets`][virgil._geometry.pixel_offsets] follow this rule.

[`render`][virgil.models.SourceModel.render] draws a model on `npix` × `npix` pixels spanning `fov_mas`, so the pixel scale is `fov_mas / npix`. The pixel scale of an [`Image`][virgil.models.Image] component is set directly by `pixel_scale_mas`. Both use the orientation above. To check it, put a [`PointSource`][virgil.models.PointSource] at `dra=10` on a 64-pixel, 64 mas grid: the brightest pixel is in row 31, column 21, to the left of centre and level with it. With `ddec=10` instead it is in row 21, column 31, above the centre.

If you plot a sky image yourself, make sure East ends up on the left and North at the top. The plotting functions in [`virgil.plotting`][virgil.plotting] do this for you however the axes were built. The project's regression tests assert the position of the brightest pixel for a known offset or position angle (for example `test_gaussian_disk_render_uses_interferometric_image_orientation`), because a mirrored image looks perfectly sensible and passes any test that only checks the image is finite.

## Baselines and the Fourier sign

A baseline is the vector between two telescopes, projected onto the plane perpendicular to the line of sight. Its components are $u$ (East-West) and $v$ (North-South), in metres. Models take `u`, `v` and a wavelength in metres, and divide: the **spatial frequencies** $u/\lambda$ and $v/\lambda$ are then in cycles per radian. They are converted with $1\,\mathrm{mas} = \pi/(180 \times 3600 \times 1000)$ rad when they meet a position in milliarcseconds.

By the van Cittert–Zernike theorem, the complex visibility is the Fourier transform of the sky brightness $I(x, y)$, normalised to 1 at zero baseline. virgil's sign convention is

$$
V(u, v) = \frac{\iint I(x, y)\, e^{-2\pi i (u x + v y)}\,dx\,dy}{\iint I(x, y)\,dx\,dy},
$$

where $x$ is `dra` and $y$ is `ddec`, both converted to radians, and $u, v$ are in cycles per radian. This is the convention of `offset_phase` (in `virgil._geometry`), and every model and every pixel-image Fourier transform in the package follows it. A point source at $(\mathrm{dra}, \mathrm{ddec})$ therefore has

$$
V = \exp\left[-2\pi i\,(u\,\mathrm{dra} + v\,\mathrm{ddec})\right],
$$

with the offsets converted to radians.

**What a positive phase means.** The phase of a point source is *minus* $2\pi$ times the dot product of the baseline and the offset, in wavelengths. So a source displaced to the East ($\mathrm{dra} > 0$) seen on a baseline with $u > 0$ has a *negative* visibility phase. A source at $\mathrm{dra} = 10$ mas on $u = 5$ m at 1 µm gives $-1.523$ rad, as it should. A positive phase means the source is displaced the other way along the baseline: towards negative $u$ (West) for an East-West baseline.

**Where $u, v$ come from in OIFITS.** An OIFITS file lists, for each baseline, `UCOORD` and `VCOORD` in metres and the two telescopes in `STA_INDEX`. [`read_oifits`][virgil.oifits.read_oifits] takes `UCOORD` and `VCOORD` as they are and does not re-sign them, so virgil's convention only gives the right answer if the file's $(u, v)$ were produced with the same one: the vector runs from the first station of `STA_INDEX` to the second, $u$ points East and $v$ North, and the phase is $\arg V$ with the sign of the equation above. The test `tests/test_pa_round_trip.py` builds files this way, in the layout of several instruments, and checks that a binary comes back at its true PA and not 180° away. Real data tests the *pipeline*: if an instrument's reduction conjugates its phases, or uses the opposite baseline direction, a companion appears on the opposite side of the primary, and only an observation of a binary with a known orbit can tell. Treat the PA of a first fit of a new instrument's data as unverified until it has been compared with a known one.

Two further details. Reversed baselines are not accepted: if a closure triangle $(a, b, c)$ needs the baseline $(a, b)$ but the file stores only $(b, a)$, reading raises an error saying so. And AMIGO's mixed-DISCO products are stored with the opposite sign of $(u, v)$, which [`load_oi_data`][virgil.amigo.load_oi_data] negates on reading.

## Observables

`OIData` holds two kinds of observable, a visibility channel and a phase channel, each with an uncertainty.

**Visibilities** come in three forms, selected by `vis_mode`:

| `vis_mode` | Model value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"v2"` | $\lvert V \rvert^2$ | squared visibility, the commonest OIFITS product |
| `"amp"` | $\lvert V \rvert$ | visibility amplitude |
| `"logamp"` | $\ln \lvert V \rvert$ | log-amplitude |

By default (`"auto"`) the data stay in the form they were supplied in. If you ask for a different one, the data and their errors are converted. The errors are propagated linearly, $\sigma_f = \lvert f'(V)\rvert\,\sigma_V$, but because the derivative of $\sqrt{V^2}$ or $\ln V^2$ blows up near zero, where noisy data can be negative, the derivative is evaluated with the data floored at their own uncertainty. For squared visibilities converted to amplitudes the error is $\sigma_{V^2} / (2\sqrt{\max(V^2, \sigma_{V^2})})$. Converting between forms is an approximation, and low-signal data are better fitted in the form they were measured in.

**Phases** are one of:

- **closure phases** (`cp_flag=True`), for a triangle of telescopes $(a, b, c)$:
  $$
  \varphi_{abc} = \varphi_{ab} + \varphi_{bc} - \varphi_{ac},
  $$
  where $\varphi_{ab}$ is the phase of the visibility on the baseline $(a, b)$. The three legs are stored as the sample indices `i_cps1`, `i_cps2` and `i_cps3`, so the closure phase is `phase[i_cps1] + phase[i_cps2] - phase[i_cps3]`, the third leg being subtracted. [`cp_indices`][virgil.oidata.cp_indices] builds the indices from station numbers, and [`closure_phases`][virgil.oidata.closure_phases] evaluates the sum. The result is wrapped into $[-\pi, \pi)$. Closure phases are unaffected by any telescope-dependent phase error, and by any shift of the whole source, which adds a phase linear in the baseline to every visibility and cancels in the sum;
- **absolute phases** (`cp_flag=False`), the phase $\arg V$ of each sample, which need a phase reference and so are rarer.

Phases are **radians inside virgil**, including every `phi` and `d_phi` attribute and the output of `closure_phases`. OIFITS stores phases in degrees, so [`read_oifits`][virgil.oifits.read_oifits] converts on reading (from the column's unit, assuming degrees if it is missing). [`write_oifits`][virgil.oifits.write_oifits] does **not** convert: its tables hold phases and phase errors in degrees, as OIFITS stores them, so convert `phi` and `d_phi` with `numpy.rad2deg` before writing (otherwise both come back about 57 times too small). A dictionary passed to `OIData` directly takes `phi_unit="deg"` for degrees.

**Wrapping and the likelihood.** A phase is an angle, so a model phase of $\pi - \epsilon$ and a data phase of $-\pi + \epsilon$ agree closely. For unprojected phases the residual $\Delta$ (model minus data) therefore enters the likelihood as the chord

$$
r = \frac{2\sin(\Delta/2)}{\sigma},
$$

which is $\Delta/\sigma$ for small $\Delta$. Its square, and so the likelihood, is unchanged when $\Delta$ changes by $2\pi$ and smooth where the phase wraps (the chord itself changes sign, so it is the squared residual, not the residual vector, that is periodic). This is a von Mises likelihood with concentration $1/\sigma^2$. `OIData.residuals` instead wraps the difference into $[-\pi, \pi)$, which is for display; fits and likelihoods never use it, but use [`whitened_residuals`][virgil.likelihood.whitened_residuals].

**Flags.** A sample is *flagged* when its `FLAG` is set in the file, or its value or uncertainty is not finite (the `vis_flag` and `phi_flag` masks mark bad samples with `True`). Flagged samples are dropped from the observables; the arrays `u`, `v` and `wavel` keep every sample. `vis_index` lists the visibility samples that were kept, and for absolute phases `phi_index` the phase samples (each is `None` when none was dropped). Flagged closure phases are instead removed from `phi`, `d_phi` and the `i_cps*` arrays themselves, so `phi_index` stays `None` for closure phases even when some were dropped.

## Closure phases with four or more telescopes

With three telescopes there is one triangle and one closure phase per frame and wavelength. With $N$ telescopes there are $N(N-1)(N-2)/6$ triangles, but only $(N-1)(N-2)/2$ of them are independent: 3 of the 4 triangles of four telescopes, 10 of the 20 for six. Triangles that share a baseline have noise in common, so treating them as independent counts the same information more than once, and makes the fits too confident.

virgil handles this by default. For each frame and wavelength it groups the triangles that share baselines, keeps only the independent combinations, and whitens them with a covariance following Kammerer et al. (2020, A&A 644, A110). That model assumes equal noise on every baseline phase, which gives a correlation of $\pm 1/3$ between two triangles that share a baseline, with the sign set by whether the shared baseline enters both triangles in the same sense, and keeps each triangle's own reported error on the diagonal. It is an approximation: when the errors on a group's triangles differ a lot, the true noise is not exactly of this form, and the $\chi^2$ is slightly off its nominal distribution. The details and the size of the effect are in the docstring of `virgil._closure`.

The practical consequences are that [`n_independent`][virgil.oidata.OIData.n_independent] counts the observables that remain, and so is what to use for degrees of freedom; and that [`whitened_residuals`][virgil.likelihood.whitened_residuals] returns one residual per independent combination, which for four or more telescopes are not the original triangles. Their likelihood takes the same chords $2\sin(\Delta/2)$ of the wrapped residuals, whitens them with that covariance, and keeps the Gaussian normalisation. Because the correlated combinations mix chords whose signs flip at $\pm\pi$, unlike the three-telescope case it jumps where a residual crosses $\pm\pi$, a 180° misfit. For the Gaussian-process image prior that goes alongside these likelihoods, see [Gaussian processes and information field theory](gp_and_ift.md).

## Fluxes

Everywhere in virgil, `flux` is a **relative weight**, and it is never an absolute brightness. This is forced by the data: a visibility is normalised to 1 at zero baseline, so only ratios of fluxes can be measured.

- In a [`System`][virgil.models.System] the visibility is the flux-weighted mean $V = \sum_i f_i V_i / \sum_i f_i$. Each component is a shape normalised to unit flux, and `flux` is how much of the total it contributes.
- Keep one **reference component**, usually the star, at `flux=1`, and fit the others relative to it. If every flux were free, scaling them all by the same factor would change nothing, and the fit would have a degeneracy. A companion's `flux` is then its companion/star flux ratio: 0.01 for a companion 100 times fainter.
- The two binary models, [`BinaryModelCartesian`][virgil.models.BinaryModelCartesian] and [`BinaryModelAngular`][virgil.models.BinaryModelAngular], keep a historical convention that agrees with the above: their `flux` *is* the companion/primary ratio, and the primary is implicitly 1. They are the only places where a `flux` is a ratio instead of a weight, and the two meanings coincide in a `System` where the primary has `flux=1` (`BinaryModelCartesian.to_system` gives the equivalent `System`).
- Fluxes are non-negative. [`Component`][virgil.models.Component]s and [`System`][virgil.models.System]s reject negative fluxes given as numbers when they are built; values changed later with `set`, or traced inside a fit, are not checked, and the two legacy binary models do not check at all, so priors and grid axes must not allow negative fluxes. The one deliberate exception is [`optimized_flux_grid`][virgil.grid_fit.optimized_flux_grid], whose best-fitting flux at each position may be negative, as the Ruffio et al. upper limits need.

Reports and plots follow the astronomer's convention instead. **Contrast** is primary/companion, so 100 for a flux ratio of 0.01, and **Δmag** is $2.5\log_{10}(\text{contrast})$, 5 mag in that example. [`flux_to_contrast`][virgil.limits.flux_to_contrast], [`contrast_to_flux`][virgil.limits.contrast_to_flux], [`flux_to_delta_mag`][virgil.limits.flux_to_delta_mag] and [`delta_mag_to_flux`][virgil.limits.delta_mag_to_flux] convert between them, and the plotting functions take `units="flux"`, `"contrast"` or `"delta_mag"`. A model parameter is therefore never called `contrast`.

**Chromatic fluxes.** A component's `flux` may be a spectrum from [`virgil.spectra`][virgil.spectra] instead of a number, which gives its weight at each wavelength (SPARCO; Kluska et al. 2014). The `ratio` of [`PowerLaw`][virgil.spectra.PowerLaw] or [`BlackBody`][virgil.spectra.BlackBody] is the flux weight *at the reference wavelength* `wavel0`, in metres (default $1.65\,\mu$m, H band), and the other wavelengths follow from the spectrum's shape: $\mathrm{ratio}\,(\lambda/\lambda_0)^{\mathrm{index}}$ for the power law (index $-4$ for a Rayleigh–Jeans star in $F_\lambda$), and a Planck curve scaled to the same value at $\lambda_0$ for the black body. The reference flux is also what is used when a model is rendered, since an image has no wavelength. Choose `wavel0` in the middle of your data, so that `ratio` is something you can interpret.

## Times and frames

Times are Modified Julian Dates in days. At MJD 60000, a float32 number can only change in steps of 0.0039 d (about 5.6 minutes), and a multi-year campaign cannot be resolved to better than that: a binary's orbital motion between nights would be quantised. virgil therefore never keeps an absolute MJD in a JAX array.

`OIData` stores each sample's time as a static float64 `t_ref` (the earliest time in the data) plus a float32 array `dt` of days since `t_ref`. A difference of up to 1000 days is resolved to about 5 seconds. [`OIData.mjd`][virgil.oidata.OIData.mjd] rebuilds the absolute float64 times, as a NumPy array, for inspection and plotting. Models of time should be written in terms of `dt`, never `mjd`.

The data also carry a `frame` number per sample. A **frame** is one exposure of one instrument, which is the unit within which closure phases make sense: the three baselines of a triangle must be measured together. [`read_oifits`][virgil.oifits.read_oifits] decides which rows belong to one exposure from their `MJD` (within about 9 s) and `INSNAME`, and the baselines tied together by closure phases. With `frame_mjd="mean"` (the default) every sample in a frame is given the mean time of the frame's rows, which is what you want when a pipeline stamps the closure-phase and visibility tables with slightly different times; `frame_mjd="row"` keeps each row's own time.

For analyses that treat nights separately, [`OIData.epochs`][virgil.oidata.OIData.epochs] labels each sample with an epoch number: a run of frames with no gap longer than `gap_days` (default 0.5 d), numbered from 0 in time order. A frame is never split between epochs. [`OIData.split_by_epoch`][virgil.oidata.OIData.split_by_epoch] returns one `OIData` per epoch, which is how you would fit a binary's position night by night. It does not work on projected (kernel or DISCO) observables.

## Orbits

!!! note "Not yet in this version"
    The conventions below were decided in the orbit design note (`design/orbit_scene_joint_fitting.md`, §2.1–2.3). The code that implements them, the `virgil.orbits` module with `KeplerOrbit`, arrives with Stage 6a.1 and is not on the main branch yet. This section describes what that code will follow.

An orbit gives the position of a **secondary** star relative to a **primary** (or reference) star, which sits at the origin and is the scene's reference component at `flux=1`. It need not be the more massive star. The relative position is $\mathbf{r} = (\mathrm{dra}, \mathrm{ddec}, dz)$ of the secondary minus the primary.

- The first two components are the sky offsets above, East and North, in mas.
- The third axis, `dz`, is positive **away from the observer**. With East, North and away-from-us, the axes form a right-handed set. So $d(dz)/dt$ has the sign of the secondary's radial velocity relative to the primary: positive means it is receding.

The angles follow the usual visual-binary conventions, with one care for each:

| Symbol | Name in code | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $i$ | `inc` | 0° to 180°. $i < 90°$ means the position angle *increases* with time (counter-clockwise on a North-up sky image) |
| $\Omega$ | `Omega` | the PA of the **ascending node**, defined as the node where the secondary *recedes* ($dz$ increasing) |
| $\omega$ | `omega` | the **secondary's** argument of periastron, from the ascending node, in the direction of motion |

The $\omega$ here is the visual-binary one, for the secondary relative to the primary. The spectroscopic convention, which describes the *primary's* motion, differs by 180°: $\omega_{\rm spec} = \omega - 180°$. Orbits taken from a radial-velocity paper need this correction. Other symbols: `period` in days, `a_mas` the angular semimajor axis of the relative orbit in mas, and `dt_peri` the time of periastron minus `t_ref` in days, relative for the float32 reason in the previous section.

**What the data cannot tell apart.** These degeneracies are properties of the geometry, not bugs.

1. $(\Omega, \omega) \to (\Omega + 180°, \omega + 180°)$ gives the same sky positions and flips the sign of $dz$. A visual orbit cannot distinguish them. Radial velocities, or a scene component that is not front-back symmetric, can.
2. $\omega \to \omega + 180°$ alone sends $\mathbf{r} \to -\mathbf{r}$ at all times. This is the same as swapping which star is the reference: a "which star is the primary" error and an "$\omega$ of which star" error are the same 180° flip.
3. $i \to 180° - i$ reverses the sense of rotation on the sky.
4. For a nearly face-on orbit the positions depend on $\Omega$ and $\omega$ only through their sum, so astrometry measures the sum well and each separately poorly.

**Swapping primary and secondary** is the same thing seen from the data. A binary with the companion at $\mathbf{r}$ and flux ratio $f$ looks, to the visibilities, like one with the companion at $-\mathbf{r}$ and flux ratio $1/f$: only the origin of the image moves (from the primary to the other star), so every squared visibility and closure phase is identical, and the visibilities differ only by a phase linear in $u$ and $v$. This was checked with `BinaryModelCartesian`: `(dra, ddec, f)` and `(-dra, -ddec, 1/f)` give the same $V^2$ and closure phases to float32 rounding, and a visibility ratio of $\exp[+2\pi i(u\,\mathrm{dra} + v\,\mathrm{ddec})]$. So the choice of which star is the reference is a convention, to be fixed once, by requiring the reference to be the brighter star in the band, say, and every PA, flux ratio and $\omega$ read afterwards must follow it.

## Precision

virgil never switches on JAX's 64-bit mode globally. All library code runs in float32 by default, and is written to give correct results in float64 too. The fitting entry points, such as [`fit`][virgil.fitting.fit], instead run their optimisation in a local float64 context: they cast the model, data and priors to float64 on the way in, and restore the setting on exit. Pass `dtype="float32"` to `fit` for the faster, less precise version. The helper that does this is `virgil._precision.run_in`, which you will see in the source.

Two things are worth knowing. First, float32 is the reason absolute times are stored as `dt`, as described above. Second, matrix products and Fourier transforms over pixels use the highest matmul precision, because on A100 and H100 GPUs the default silently uses TF32 and a relative error of about $10^{-3}$.
