The present version of `drpangloss` actually represents a synthesis of many projects from a whole research team and features we have liked from other packages, where we have used Claude Code Opus 5.5 not to develop everything from scratch but to take a lot of existing ideas and connect them in a common framework. GitHub Copilot's coding agent also wrote a good deal of the code in 2026, especially tests, fixes in response to code review, the Laplace uncertainty tools for grid searches, and some tutorials. The commit history therefore does not properly reflect the credit to be assigned to people and their ideas.

The project began as a collection of functions by Dori Blakely for the [Blakely et al 2024 PDS 70 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13032), and then was rewritten (with human hands!) by Benjamin Pope and Louis Desdoigts for a series of related projects, which we put out as the first `drpangloss` repo. In particular Louis is to be credited with the fast Jax syntax for grid searches, and with the first kernel-phase support. Dori also worked on the first example notebook of Bayesian upper limits following [Ruffio et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08261). The project was called `drpangloss` as a reference to Voltaire's *Candide* and Antoine Mérand's code [CANDID](https://github.com/amerand/CANDID). Doctor Pangloss in that work is known for his (irrational and excessive) belief we are in the best of all possible worlds and this was a fun way to think about having CANDID with better optimisers.

Several of Louis's other projects run through the package. Every model is built on his [zodiax](https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/zodiax), whose dot-paths (`"comp.flux"`) are the public fitting interface. The AMI data products come from his AMIGO pipeline ([Desdoigts et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09806)): `drpangloss.amigo` reads its mixed-DISCO format, and `drpangloss.coverage` simulates data in that form, following AMIGO's latent visibility basis. The matrix Fourier transform was checked against the one in his [dLux](https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/dLux).

We have added a number of geometric primitives from Dori Blakely's paper and Jonah Goldfine's unpublished work on PDS 70 and from Toon De Prins' work on post-AGB disks. Toon also wrote the image coordinate convention (East left, North up, position angles North to East) that the whole package now follows, and found and fixed the bugs that had broken it, in `BinaryModelAngular`'s position angle and in the orientation of the plots. We have also merged Shashank Dholakia's unpublished thesis work on the visibilities of rapidly-rotating stars, and implemented an interface to his [harmonix](https://github.com/shashankdholakia/harmonix/) package, and re-implemented and improved Pope's contribution to this in the Jax Bessel function implementations. The Jax translation of the [CEPHES](https://www.netlib.org/cephes/) Bessel functions in `drpangloss.bessel` is itself adapted from harmonix. Back in 2024, Shashank also made `drpangloss` work with spectrally dispersed data, with several wavelength channels in one OIFITS file. All of these inclusions were accomplished with Claude Code.

The legacy OIFITS tools in `drpangloss.legacy` are derived from [ImPlaneIA](https://github.com/anand0xff/ImPlaneIA), the NIRISS AMI analysis package of Anand Sivaramakrishnan and collaborators.

The image deconvolution code is largely a port and extension of the visibility-based part of `dorito` by Max Charles, written for [his paper on JWST NIRISS/AMI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10924). To this we have added Gaussian Process image priors abstracted from the Enßlin group's [nifty](https://ift.pages.mpcdf.de/nifty/user/index.html). Some of the inspiration for `dorito` was from our colleague Ian Czekala's package [MPoL](https://mpol-dev.github.io/MPoL/). Both the port and the Gaussian Process priors were accomplished with Claude Code.

## Methods

Much of the package implements methods from the literature, which we cite in the docstrings where they are used:

- detection limits following [CANDID](https://github.com/amerand/CANDID) ([Gallenne et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02715)) and [Absil et al. (2011)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.1178), and Bayesian upper limits following [Ruffio et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08261);
- chromatic scenes of stars and an environment with their own spectra, following SPARCO ([Kluska et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3343));
- maximum-entropy imaging, and the choice of its weight by Gull and Skilling's "classic MaxEnt" (Gull 1989; Skilling & Bryan 1984);
- the Bayesian evidence for regularisation hyperparameters and the re-estimation of error bars, following MacKay (1992);
- the matrix Fourier transform of [Soummer et al. (2007)](https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0368).

## Software

`drpangloss` is built on [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax), and on Patrick Kidger's [equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox), [optimistix](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/optimistix) and [lineax](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/lineax), together with [optax](https://github.com/google-deepmind/optax), [numpyro](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/numpyro) and, optionally, [blackjax](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax).
