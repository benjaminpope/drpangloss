# Contributions

`virgil` is a synthesis of many projects from a research team, and of ideas we liked in other packages. We used Claude Code (Opus 5.5) to connect existing ideas in one framework, not to write everything from scratch. GitHub Copilot's coding agent wrote much of the code in 2026, especially tests, review fixes, the Laplace uncertainties for grid searches, and some tutorials. The commit history therefore does not show who deserves credit for which ideas. The [Development carbon](dev_carbon.md) page estimates the energy and carbon cost of this AI-assisted work.

## History

- **drpangloss.** Dori Blakely began the project as a set of functions for the [PDS 70 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13032) (Blakely et al. 2025, AJ 169, 137). Benjamin Pope and Louis Desdoigts then rewrote it by hand as `drpangloss`. Louis wrote the fast JAX grid searches (the basis of `grid_fit`) and the first kernel-phase support. Dori wrote the first notebook of Bayesian upper limits. The name was a joke on Voltaire's *Candide* and Antoine Mérand's [CANDID](https://github.com/amerand/CANDID): Doctor Pangloss believes we live in the best of all possible worlds, much as CANDID with better optimizers would.
- **virgil.** By 2026 the joke no longer fitted, and the team adopted Benjamin Pope's suggestion of `virgil`. Jonah Goldfine came up with the acronym: the Versatile Interferometric Reconstruction and Gradient-based Inference Library. In Dante's *Divine Comedy*, Virgil guides the poet through the underworld; the README explains why that suits image reconstruction.

## People and their projects

- **Louis Desdoigts.**
  - Every model is built on his [zodiax](https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/zodiax), whose dot-paths (`"comp.flux"`) are the public fitting interface.
  - `virgil.amigo` reads the mixed-DISCO format of his AMIGO pipeline ([Desdoigts et al. 2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09806), PASA 43, e075). `virgil.coverage` simulates data in that form, following AMIGO's latent visibility basis.
  - The matrix Fourier transform was checked against the one in his [dLux](https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/dLux) ([Desdoigts et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08703)).
- **Shashank Dholakia.**
  - He made `drpangloss` handle spectrally dispersed data in 2024.
  - `GravityDarkenedStar` comes from his unpublished thesis work on rapidly rotating stars. Its equations are those of [Espinosa Lara & Rieutord (2011)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.3038); its implementation follows Aaron Dotter's [GDit](https://github.com/aarondotter/GDit).
  - virgil has an interface to his [harmonix](https://github.com/shashankdholakia/harmonix/) ([Dholakia & Pope 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25433)).
  - The JAX translation of the [CEPHES](https://www.netlib.org/cephes/) Bessel functions, now the separate package [jaxbessel](https://github.com/benjaminpope/jaxbessel), is adapted from harmonix.
- **Max Charles.** The image reconstruction is largely a port and extension of the visibility-based part of his `dorito`, written for [his NIRISS AMI paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10924) (PASA 43, e048, 2026). Some of the inspiration for `dorito` came from Ian Czekala's [MPoL](https://mpol-dev.github.io/MPoL/).
- **Jonah Goldfine.** The parametric scenes (`virgil.scenes`) come from his [frito](https://github.com/JonahDG/frito), together with geometric primitives from his unpublished work on PDS 70.
- **Toon De Prins.**
  - He contributed the inclined, azimuthally modulated rim (`ModulatedGaussianRim`) and the elliptical transforms, from his work on post-AGB disks.
  - He reviewed and fixed the 0.4.0 release, including the pipeline layer.
- **Dori Blakely.** Besides starting the project, Dori contributed the flared-disk geometry from the PDS 70 paper.
- **Frantz Martinache.** The binary visibility function `cvis_binary` is adapted from his [xara](https://github.com/fmartinache/xara) (formerly pysco; [Martinache 2010](https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.3933)).

Claude Code made the harmonix, ELR, dorito, scenes and Gaussian-process inclusions.

## Software

`virgil` is built on [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax) and on Patrick Kidger's [equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox), [optimistix](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/optimistix) and [lineax](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/lineax), with [optax](https://github.com/google-deepmind/optax), [numpyro](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/numpyro), [jaxoplanet](https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/jaxoplanet) and [jaxbessel](https://github.com/benjaminpope/jaxbessel). [AMICAL](https://github.com/SAIL-Labs/AMICAL) reduces the ground-based aperture-masking data used in the examples.
