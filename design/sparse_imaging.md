# Design note: sparse image reconstruction

## Purpose and scope

This note plans support for **sparse** reconstructions in virgil: images
made of a few compact features, or of structure that is compact in some
basis. Sparse imaging suits scenes that the smoothness priors of
`design/image_reconstruction.md` (maximum entropy, TSV, the Gaussian-process
field) handle badly: point-like companions, knots and sharp edges next to
extended emission.

Two existing codes set the scope:
- **SQUEEZE** (Baron, Monnier & Kloppenborg; github.com/fabienbaron/squeeze),
  whose L0 regulariser is the standard sparsity prior in optical
  interferometry;
- **CLEAN** (Högbom 1974), the basic image-restoration algorithm of radio
  astronomy.

## The obstacle: an L1 penalty on the pixels is constant

An [`Image`][virgil.models.Image]'s pixels are ``b = softmax(η)`` over its
support: positive and summing to one. So ``‖b‖₁ = 1`` for every image, and
an L1 penalty on the pixels does nothing. Positivity and a fixed flux
already contain the L1 constraint; that is why SQUEEZE uses L0, not L1.
The softmax also means pixels approach zero but never reach it, so a MAP
image is never exactly sparse.

Sparsity therefore has to come from one of:
1. **L1 in another basis**, such as the starlet (isotropic undecimated
   wavelet) coefficients of the image. TV is already this: an L1 norm of the
   image's gradient, smoothed by ε.
2. **A non-convex penalty on the pixels**, a smooth surrogate for L0, such as
   the log-sum penalty Σ log(1 + b/ε) (Candès, Wakin & Boyd 2008).
3. **A linear parameterisation of the pixels** (b ≥ 0, directly), with a
   solver that handles a non-smooth penalty (proximal gradient). This is the
   only route to exact zeros.
4. **A greedy algorithm** that adds point-like components one at a time:
   CLEAN.

## SQUEEZE: what it has, and what virgil does with it

SQUEEZE 3.0's README lists the regularisers L0, total variation, Laplacian,
maximum entropy and "dark energy". Its engine is parallel simulated
annealing (or parallel tempering) with Metropolis–Hastings moves of discrete
flux elements between pixels. It fits SPARCO and binary-plus-image models,
images polychromatically, models bandwidth smearing and computes marginal
likelihoods. Its papers describe wavelet regularisation in a compressed
sensing framework.

| SQUEEZE feature | virgil | Plan |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Total variation, maximum entropy | `TV`, `MaxEntropy` | nothing |
| L0 | none | `LogSum`, a smooth surrogate (S1) |
| Laplacian | none | `Laplacian`, quadratic so LM can fit it (S1) |
| Wavelet sparsity | none | `StarletL1` and `starlet` (S1) |
| Dark energy | none | deferred: its definition is not in the README; check the source first |
| SPARCO, binary + image | `System` + `Image` + `spectra.PowerLaw` | nothing |
| Marginal likelihood | `log_evidence` for Gaussian forms | not for L1/L0, which have no Laplace-approximation evidence |
| Bandwidth smearing | deferred in `image_reconstruction.md` | separate item |
| Annealing / tempering of flux elements | NUTS and MAP | not ported: discrete moves get nothing from gradients or JAX |

The non-convex penalties have local minima. SQUEEZE escapes them by
annealing; virgil uses starting points instead: a parametric fit, the dirty
image, or a CLEAN model (S2).

## CLEAN

**Classic Högbom CLEAN** repeatedly finds the peak of the residual dirty
image and subtracts a fraction (the loop gain) of the dirty beam there. It
needs data that are linear in the image: complex visibilities with calibrated
phases. With closure phases it needs hybrid mapping (self-calibration loops),
which fits virgil badly and is fragile on sparse optical and AMI coverage.
virgil's [`dirty_image`][virgil.imaging.dirty_image] is a least-squares
estimate, so its beam is not the plain uv point-spread function either. We do
not implement classic CLEAN.

**Gradient CLEAN** is what we build. For linear data, the residual dirty image
is proportional to −∂χ²/∂c, the gradient of χ² with respect to the flux of a
point added at each pixel, and Högbom's peak search picks its most negative
pixel. Written that way, CLEAN needs only the gradient of virgil's likelihood,
which JAX gives in one backward pass for any data: closure phases, kernel
phases, DISCOs, V², or a mix. Each iteration:
1. computes ``g = ∂χ²/∂c`` over the pixels, where ``c ≥ 0`` are the
   components' fluxes;
2. picks the pixel ``p`` in the support whose Gauss–Newton step lowers χ²
   most, the largest ``g_p² / ‖J e_p‖²`` with ``g_p < 0``, and stops if no
   pixel lowers χ²;
3. adds ``gain × Δ`` to ``c_p``, where ``Δ = −g_p / (2‖J e_p‖²)`` is the
   Gauss–Newton step, from one Jacobian–vector product;
4. stops when χ² per data point reaches a target (default 1, the discrepancy
   principle), or after ``max_iterations``.

The atom norms ``‖J e_p‖²`` are computed once, at the start, with one
Jacobian–vector product per pixel (a row of pixels at a time, so the Jacobian
is never held whole).

For linear data ``‖J e_p‖`` is the same at every pixel, so steps 2 and 3 are
exactly Högbom's: the residual peak, divided by the beam's peak.
Mathematically this is matching pursuit with normalised atoms.

The components are fluxes relative to a fixed **base scene** (usually an
analytic star at flux 1), so the model is
``V = (w V_base + Σ c_p e_p) / (w + Σ c_p)``, smooth in ``c`` even at
``c = 0``. Without a base scene, the components alone make the image, and
CLEAN starts from one component at the centre (closure phases cannot fix the
position, so this is also the anchor).

The result is an ordinary virgil model: ``System(base=..., clean=Image(...))``
whose Image has support only where ``c > 0``. So it can be polished with
``fit`` on that support, used as a starting image for RML, or convolved with
the beam (``convolve_beam``) to give the "restored" image of radio astronomy.

Limitations, accepted for S2:
- Components are only added, never removed. A wrong early component stays
  (Högbom CLEAN can subtract negative components; we keep positivity). A
  final ``fit`` on the support can move flux among the components.
- The base scene's parameters are fixed during CLEAN; fit them first.
- The components are grey: their flux is a fixed fraction of the base
  scene's at every wavelength.

## Stages

Each stage is a PR with tests and an entry in the stage log below. S1 and S2
share one MWE notebook, `notebooks/mwe/mwe_sparse_imaging.ipynb`, added with
S2, because `LogSum` is best started from a CLEAN model.

### S1: smooth sparsity regularisers

- `starlet(b, scales)`: the isotropic undecimated wavelet transform
  (à-trous, B3-spline kernel; Starck, Murtagh & Fadili 2010), with zeros
  beyond the edges, as in `TV`. Its detail planes and coarse plane sum back to
  the image.
- `StarletL1(weight, scales=4, epsilon=1e-2)`: ``weight × Σ √(w² + ε²)``
  over the detail coefficients, ε a fraction of the mean pixel flux, like
  `TV`.
- `LogSum(weight, epsilon=1e-2)`: ``weight × Σ log(1 + b / (ε b̄))``, a
  smooth surrogate for L0, where b̄ is the mean pixel flux over the support.
- `Laplacian(weight)`: ``weight × Σ (∇²b)²`` with the five-point stencil;
  it has residuals, so LM can fit it.
- The pixel L1 identity is documented in the `virgil.imaging` docstring.

All three plug into `fit`, `l_curve` and `diagnose` unchanged.

### S2: gradient CLEAN

`clean(data, npix, pixel_scale_mas, base=None, *, gain=0.1,
max_iterations=1000, target_chi2_red=1.0, support=None, init=None,
rotation_deg=0.0, dtype="float64")` returning a `CleanResult` with the
model, the component fluxes, the χ² history and why it stopped, and a
`restored(beam)` method.

### S3: proximal solver (only if S1 is not sparse enough)

A linear-brightness Image option; `fit(method="fista")` for proximal gradient
with projection onto the simplex (optax's `projection_simplex`) and gradient
steps on the analytic parameters; regularisers gain `prox()`. Starlet L1
has no closed-form prox for a redundant transform, so it needs a primal–dual
method (Condat–Vũ). This is the only stage that touches `Image` and `fit`.

### S4: sparse sampling (deferred)

Horseshoe or Laplace priors on starlet coefficients through `numpyro_model`.
Deferred: the posterior mean under a Laplace prior is not sparse (the
"Bayesian lasso"), and the Gaussian-process prior already covers sampling.

## Deferred items

| Item | Revisit when |
| --- | --- |
| Dark-energy regulariser | Someone needs it; read its definition in SQUEEZE's source first |
| Removing CLEAN components (away steps) | Early wrong components spoil real reconstructions |
| Fitting the base scene during CLEAN | A base parameter cannot be fitted beforehand |
| Residual map in flux units (per-pixel curvature) | Restored images need residuals added |
| S3, proximal solver | S1 images are not sparse enough to matter scientifically |
| S4, sparse sampling | A science case needs uncertainties on a sparse image |

## Stage log

### S1

`Laplacian`, `starlet`, `StarletL1` and `LogSum` in `virgil.imaging`, with
tests in `tests/test_sparse_imaging.py`. Like `TV`, their ε is an array, so a
new value does not recompile a fit. Zero padding means a flat image has
starlet details at its edges, as it has differences for TV: flux at the edge
of the field is penalised.

### S2

`clean` and `CleanResult` in `virgil.imaging`. `Image`'s matrix-Fourier
path is now a shared helper, `models._pixel_visibilities`, used by the
private `_CleanScene` too.

The first version picked the pixel with the most negative gradient, as
Högbom's peak search does. On AMI DISCO data of a star with a 5% companion,
it put 0.45 of the star's flux in the pixel next to the star: there, both
the gradient and ``‖J e_p‖`` are small, so the Gauss–Newton step is huge.
With the selection normalised by ``‖J e_p‖²`` (the predicted fall in χ²),
CLEAN put its brightest component on the companion's pixel and reached
χ²/N = 1 after 28 iterations, with 0.034 of the 0.05 companion flux
(stopping at the discrepancy point under-recovers flux).
