"""Regularisers and helpers for image reconstruction.

An image fit is a call to [`fit`][virgil.fitting.fit] whose model contains an
[`Image`][virgil.models.Image], with a prior on its ``log_brightness``
(see :func:`image_priors`) and usually a regulariser, which adds a penalty
on the pixel fluxes ``b`` to the loss:

| Regulariser | Penalty | Least squares (LM)? | A prior density? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`TSV`][virgil.imaging.TSV] | ``w Σ (Δx b)² + (Δy b)²`` | yes | no |
| [`TV`][virgil.imaging.TV] | ``w Σ √((Δx b)² + (Δy b)² + ε²)`` | no | no |
| [`MaxEntropy`][virgil.imaging.MaxEntropy] | ``w Σ b log(b / q)`` | no | no |
| [`Laplacian`][virgil.imaging.Laplacian] | ``w Σ (∇²b)²`` | yes | no |
| [`StarletL1`][virgil.imaging.StarletL1] | ``w Σ √(s² + ε²)`` over starlet details ``s`` | no | no |
| [`LogSum`][virgil.imaging.LogSum] | ``w Σ log(1 + b / (ε b̄))`` | no | no |
| [`Centroid`][virgil.imaging.Centroid] | ``½ |centroid / σ|²`` | yes | yes |

Differences ``Δ`` are between neighbouring pixels, with zeros beyond the
edges, so edge pixels are penalised too. TSV (total squared variation) and
the Laplacian favour smooth images, TV (total variation) piecewise-flat ones,
and maximum entropy images close to a default ``q``. The weight ``w``
depends on the scene and the data; :func:`l_curve` sweeps it.

Sparse images, made of a few compact features, need a different penalty. An
L1 norm of the pixels does not work: they are positive and sum to one, so
``Σ |b| = 1`` for every image. ``StarletL1`` is an L1 norm of the image's
wavelet (starlet) coefficients instead, which favours images built from few
compact structures at any scale. ``LogSum`` is a smooth surrogate for the
number of bright pixels (the L0 "norm" of SQUEEZE). It is not convex, so the
fit can stop in a local minimum: start it from a good image, such as a
[`clean`][virgil.imaging.clean] model.

[`clean`][virgil.imaging.clean] builds a sparse image directly, from point
components added one at a time where the gradient of χ² is steepest: CLEAN
for any data, including closure and DISCO phases.
``design/sparse_imaging.md`` discusses the choices.

When [`fit`][virgil.fitting.fit]'s model function returns one model per
dataset, every regulariser acts on the **first model only**. That is right
when the later models are transformed copies of the same scene (e.g. a
[`Rotated`][virgil.models.Rotated] epoch), but an Image that appears only in
a later model is not regularised at all.

Closure, kernel and DISCO phases do not fix an image's position. Something
must: an analytic star at the origin, a [`Centroid`][virgil.imaging.Centroid]
prior, or a centred prior mean. [`diagnose`][virgil.imaging.diagnose]
checks a fit for this and other common pitfalls.

    weights on the informed ones: the image convolved with the dirty beam,
    plus noise. It peaks at one for a lone point source. For AMIGO DISCO
    data the visibilities are the least-squares estimate from the modes;

    normalised to |V| = 1 on average on the shortest baselines.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : OIData or sequence of OIData

    npix : int

    pixel_scale_mas : float

    flux_ratio : float, optional
        If the scene is a star at the origin plus extended emission with
        this flux relative to the star, the star is removed first, so the
        map shows the extended emission alone. The star is removed by
        subtracting the best-fitting point source at the origin (the
        weighted mean of the visibilities), then scaling by
        ``(1 + flux_ratio) / flux_ratio``. That is robust to the
        normalisation of the visibilities, which matters because subtracting
        a bright star amplifies any error in it by ``1 / flux_ratio``.

    """A starting model for an image fit, sized from the data.

    It fits a quick parametric model, an analytic star (if ``star``) plus a
    circular Gaussian envelope with free flux and width, a low-order
    description of the visibilities, from a few starting widths. Then it
    chooses the image:

    * a field of about six FWHMs of the envelope, but at least 500 mas, and
      never larger than the interferometric field of view (λ / B_min) or
      ``largest_mas``;
    * pixels ``oversample`` times finer than the Nyquist scale;
    * an [`Image`][virgil.models.Image] with the fitted flux, whose
      pixels are the fitted Gaussian (``start="moments"``) or the positive
      part of the :func:`dirty_image` (``start="dirty"``, with the star
      removed). A dirty start is better when the Fourier coverage is dense
      (it already has the right shape) and worse when it is sparse (its
      sidelobes dominate).

    Fit it with ``fit(start, image_priors(start), data, regularisers)``,
    adding a prior on the image's flux, ``"env.flux"`` (or ``"flux"`` with
    ``star=False``), to fit it too: with a star, this stops the fit from
    parking excess flux next to it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : OIData or sequence of OIData
        The data.
    star : bool, optional
        Whether the scene has an unresolved star at the origin (which also
        fixes the image's position). Without one, the result is the Image
        alone, and a [`Centroid`][virgil.imaging.Centroid] prior
        should fix its position.
    oversample : float, optional
        Pixels per Nyquist pixel.
    largest_mas : float, optional
        A cap on the field of view.
    start : {"moments", "dirty"}, optional
        The starting pixels, as above.
    hole_mas : float, optional
        Radius of a hole in the image's support under the star. Extended
        flux within a fraction of a beam of the star is nearly
        indistinguishable from the star's own, so without a hole the fit can
        trade the two and bias the flux ratio; half the beam's minor axis
        (``0.5 * beam(data).minor_mas``) is a good choice.

    Reconstructed images are super-resolved. A regularised image can put

    beam (the "restored" image of radio astronomy), it shows only what the

    The kernel is an elliptical Gaussian with the beam's FWHMs and position
    angle (North to East), normalised to unit sum. It is sampled on an odd
    grid centred on a pixel, so the convolution does not shift the image.
    Flux beyond the edge of the image is taken to be zero, and the result

    Högbom's CLEAN repeatedly finds the peak of the residual dirty image
    and adds a fraction (the loop ``gain``) of a point source there. For
    data that are linear in the image, the residual dirty image is
    proportional to ``-∂χ²/∂c``, the gradient of χ² with respect to the
    flux ``c_p`` of a point at each pixel. This function uses that gradient
    directly, so it works for any data virgil can fit: closure phases,
    kernel or DISCO phases, squared visibilities, or a mix. ``J e_p`` is
    the change in the whitened residuals per unit flux at pixel ``p``. Each
    iteration picks the pixel whose Gauss–Newton step would lower χ² most,
    the largest ``g_p² / |J e_p|²`` with ``g_p < 0``, and adds ``gain``
    times that step, ``-g_p / (2 |J e_p|²)``. This is matching pursuit; for
    linear data, where ``|J e_p|`` is the same everywhere, it is exactly
    Högbom's CLEAN. The norms ``|J e_p|`` are computed once, at the start,
    with one Jacobian–vector product per pixel. Normalising by them matters
    next to an analytic star, where flux in a pixel is nearly the same as
    the star's: the gradient there is small, but so is ``|J e_p|``, and an
    unnormalised search would pile flux beside the star.

    Components are added relative to a fixed ``base`` scene, usually an
    analytic star at flux 1; fit its parameters first. They are never
    removed, so the fluxes stay non-negative. Without a base, the components
    alone make the image, starting from one at the centre of the grid
    (closure phases do not fix the position, so this is also the anchor).

    Iteration stops when χ² per data point reaches ``target_chi2_red`` (the
    discrepancy principle; it relies on correct error bars), when no pixel
    lowers χ², or after ``max_iterations``.

def error_scale(model, data, path="env"):
    r"""Re-estimate the scale of the error bars from a Gaussian-field fit.

    **What it does.** It estimates the factor ``s`` by which every error
    bar should be multiplied for the data to be consistent with the fit.
    ``s < 1`` means the error bars are too large; ``s > 1`` that they are
    too small, or that the model is missing something.

    **The idea.** In MacKay's evidence framework, the level of the noise is
    a hyperparameter, like the prior's ``sigma`` and ``length_mas``. Write
    the noise precision as β = 1/s², so that the likelihood is
    ``exp(-β χ²/2)``, with χ² computed with the quoted errors. The
    Laplace-approximated evidence, as a function of β, is maximised when

    $$\frac{1}{\beta} = s^2 = \frac{\chi^2}{N - \gamma},
    \qquad \gamma = \sum_i \frac{\beta\lambda_i}{1 + \beta\lambda_i}.$$

    ``N`` is the number of data. ``γ`` is the **effective number of
    parameters** the data measure: the ``λ_i`` are the eigenvalues of the
    Gauss–Newton curvature ``JᵀJ`` of the likelihood (with the quoted
    errors) in the field's whitened latents, in which the prior's curvature
    is the identity, so that ``βλ_i`` are those of the rescaled likelihood.
    A direction with ``βλ ≫ 1`` is fixed by the data and counts as one
    parameter; one with ``βλ ≪ 1`` is fixed by the prior and counts as none.
    Since ``γ`` depends on ``β``, the equation is solved for ``β`` at the
    fitted model (by Newton's method, which converges monotonically from
    ``β = 0`` because ``γ`` is concave in ``β``).

    Each measured parameter uses up one datum's worth of scatter. So of the
    ``N`` residuals, only ``N − γ`` are free to scatter, and an honest error
    bar gives χ² ≈ N − γ, not N. The ordinary "χ² per point" estimate,
    ``s² = χ²/N``, is biased low for the same reason as the 1/N estimate of
    a sample variance; this is its Bayesian, nonlinear generalisation. It is
    MacKay's re-estimation formula for β (MacKay 1992, eq. 4.10, with γ
    from eq. 4.9; Bishop 2006, eqs. 3.91–3.95).

    **How to use it.** Fit at your chosen hyperparameters, call this, rescale
    the data with
    [`OIData.with_error_scale`][virgil.oidata.OIData.with_error_scale],
    and refit. The fit itself depends on the errors, so in principle
    fitting and rescaling is a fixed-point iteration; in practice one
    rescaling usually suffices. Error bars that are too large make the
    discrepancy principle, classic MaxEnt and the evidence all
    over-regularise, so rescale before choosing hyperparameters with any of
    them. The estimate assumes the model is adequate: if the data contain
    structure the model cannot fit, ``s`` absorbs it.

    Only the field's latents are counted in ``γ``. Each other fitted
    parameter (the image's flux, a star's position, a spectral index) that
    the data measure lowers ``N − γ`` by about one more, and so raises
    ``s`` by a fraction of about 1/(2N). That is negligible while such
    parameters are few compared with the data, as in every SPARCO fit.

    It uses the data's quoted errors, so it does not support fits with
    ``noise=`` terms (which estimate the errors another way), nor fits with
    one model per dataset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : SourceModel or FitResult
        The MAP model, whose Image at ``path`` has a GaussianField
        log-brightness, or better the
        [`FitResult`][virgil.fitting.FitResult] itself, so that fitted
        ``noise=`` terms are caught (a ``ValueError``). A list of models
        raises a ``TypeError``.
    data : OIData or sequence of OIData
        The data it was fitted to.
    path : str, optional
        Path of the Image in the model (default ``"env"``).

    The weights are fitted from largest to smallest, each starting from the

    the trade-off between fitting the data and regularising the image, and
    compare [`LCurve.corner`][virgil.imaging.LCurve.corner] and
    [`LCurve.discrepancy`][virgil.imaging.LCurve.discrepancy] with
