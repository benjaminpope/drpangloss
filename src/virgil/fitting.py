"""Maximum a posteriori fits of models, including images.

[`fit`][virgil.fitting.fit] takes the same arguments as

    """Find the maximum a posteriori parameters of a model given data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : SourceModel or callable
        A template model whose leaves at the paths in ``priors`` are fitted
        (their values are the starting point), or a function called with the
        parameters as keyword arguments, as for
        [`numpyro_model`][virgil.likelihood.numpyro_model]. The function
        may return a list of models, one per dataset, sharing parameters:
        for example a scene and a [`Rotated`][virgil.models.Rotated]
        copy of it, for two epochs between which it turns. Regularisers
        then act on the first model only: an Image that appears only in a
        later model is not regularised.
    priors : dict[str, numpyro.distributions.Distribution]
        A prior for each free parameter, keyed by its path (e.g.
        ``"comp.flux"`` or ``"env.log_brightness"``; see
        [`image_priors`][virgil.imaging.image_priors]). Priors on
        fluxes must have non-negative support.
    data : OIData or sequence of OIData
        The data, fitted jointly.
    regularisers : sequence, optional
        Penalties added to the loss, e.g. from
        [`virgil.imaging`][virgil.imaging].
    noise : dict or list of dict, optional
        Priors on error-inflation terms to fit with the parameters:
        ``vis_scale`` and ``phi_scale`` multiply the uncertainties, and
        ``vis_error_rel`` (a fraction of the model visibility) and
        ``phi_error`` (radians) are added in quadrature (see
        [`inflated_errors`][virgil.likelihood.inflated_errors]). A dict
        applies to every dataset (values ``"noise.<term>"``); a list gives
        each dataset its own (``"noise[i].<term>"``). The loss is then the
        full Gaussian negative log likelihood, including ``Σ log σ``, so the
        default method is L-BFGS. Fitting error terms with an image is
        degenerate (a smoother image with larger errors fits as well):
        estimate them with a parametric model first.
    init : dict, optional
        Starting values by path (or ``noise`` site), overriding the
        template's (required for a function model).
    method : {"lm", "lbfgs", "adam"}, optional
        ``"lm"``: Levenberg–Marquardt (optimistix) on the residuals. Its
        inner solve is a dense QR of the Jacobian for up to 200 unconstrained
        coordinates, and otherwise matrix-free (``cg_steps``
        conjugate-gradient steps on the normal equations), so that the
        Jacobian of a larger image is never formed. The default when the whole
        objective has a least-squares form.
        ``"lbfgs"``: L-BFGS (optax) on the loss, for penalties
        such as maximum entropy and total variation; the default otherwise.
        No unconstrained coordinate moves by more than ``max_step_size``
        per step, so that log-brightness pixels cannot be switched off by
        one long step.
        ``"adam"``: Adam with ``learning_rate``, run for ``max_steps``.
    max_steps : int, optional
        Step limit (defaults: 1000 for LM, 20000 for L-BFGS, 2000 for Adam).
        It sets the length of LM's and Adam's loops, so a new value
        recompiles them (not L-BFGS); other numbers do not.
    gtol : float, optional
        LM and L-BFGS stop when no component of the gradient of the loss
        per data point exceeds ``gtol``, nor 1/1000 of its largest starting
        value (so that a fit started near a solution, e.g. along an
        L-curve, still converges). The tolerance is never below √eps of the
        dtype times that starting value (3.5e-4 times it in float32), which
        rounding errors in the gradient would not let the fit reach, nor
        below ``1e-6 * gtol``, so that a fit started exactly at a
        zero-residual optimum, whose gradient is rounding noise, is
        converged at once.
    max_step_size : float, optional
        L-BFGS moves no unconstrained coordinate by more than this per step
        (for a log-brightness pixel, a factor ``exp(max_step_size)``).
        Uncapped, its line search accepts steps that drive pixels so dark
        that their gradient vanishes and they never recover, leaving the fit
        at a spurious stationary point far above the minimum. Coordinates
        with real support (e.g. a position under a Normal prior) are in
        their own units, so raise this if they must move far.
    learning_rate : float, optional
        Adam's learning rate, in unconstrained coordinates.
    cg_steps : int, optional
        Conjugate-gradient steps per LM step, for more than 200 coordinates.
        The inner solve runs for exactly this many steps, or as many as
        there are coordinates if fewer: its tolerances are zero, because an
        inner solve that stops at a step limit would abort the outer one.
    dtype : {"float64", "float32"}, optional
        Precision of the fit. The default runs in float64 inside a local
        ``jax.enable_x64`` context. The returned model and values are cast
        back to JAX's precision outside the fit (float32, unless x64 is
        enabled), so that they work with the rest of your code.

    Near the maximum a posteriori, the posterior is close to a Gaussian

    observables, it cut the cost to 63 steps per draw.

    Use it at fixed field hyperparameters (σ and ℓ, chosen for example by
    [`log_evidence`][virgil.imaging.log_evidence]). The curvature
    depends on them, so a matrix computed at one σ and ℓ is wrong when
    they move. Every sampled parameter must be in ``priors``: a
    tightly constrained one left out (such as an image's flux) keeps its
    identity mass and its tiny step size.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model, priors, data
        As for [`fit`][virgil.fitting.fit]. The priors must have a
        least-squares form (Normal, Uniform or ImproperUniform), as for
        ``fit``'s Levenberg–Marquardt.
    values : dict
        The parameter values at which to take the curvature, normally
        ``fit(model, priors, data).values``.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Keyword arguments for ``numpyro.infer.NUTS``:
        ``inverse_mass_matrix``, ``dense_mass``, and
        ``adapt_mass_matrix=False``. Warmup adaptation is switched off
        because a dense covariance estimated from a few hundred draws in
        thousands of dimensions is far worse than this matrix.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> result = fit(scene, priors, data)
    >>> kernel = NUTS(numpyro_model(result.model, priors, data),
    ...               init_strategy=init_to_value(values=result.values),
