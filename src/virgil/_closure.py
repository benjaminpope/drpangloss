"""Independent, whitened closure phases.

The closure phase of triangle (a, b, c) is φ_ab + φ_bc − φ_ac. Noise on the
baseline phases makes the closure phases of triangles that share a baseline
correlated, and with N telescopes only (N−1)(N−2)/2 of the triangles of one
frame and channel are independent: three of four, for four telescopes.
Treating all four as independent counts the closure phases 4/3 times.

The covariance model is that of Kammerer et al. (2020, A&A 644, A110,
§2.2): the reported variances σ² on the diagonal, and a fixed correlation
between triangles from equal noise on every baseline,

    C = D^½ R D^½,   R = T Tᵀ / 3,   D = diag(σ²),

where T is the triangle-by-baseline matrix of +1, +1, −1 entries; R has unit
diagonal and ±1/3 between triangles sharing a baseline. C keeps every
reported error, is never indefinite, and scales with the errors, so
rescaled or inflated errors carry through.

This is an approximation whenever the σ within a group differ. True
closure phases are exact closures T b of baseline phases b, so their noise
lies in the column space of T, while C spans D^½ times it: the two agree
only for equal σ. With unequal σ the χ² of real closure-phase noise is
slightly off its nominal distribution (for four telescopes with one noisy
baseline, a mean of 2.87 against the 3 expected for three independent
closure phases), and :meth:`ClosureNoise.sample` draws noise from C that is
not the closure of any set of baseline phases. The exact model would be
C = T diag(s) Tᵀ with baseline variances s chosen to reproduce σ².

``ClosureNoise`` groups the triangles that share baselines (one frame and
channel each). It whitens residuals r by dividing by σ, projecting onto an
orthonormal basis Q of the column space of T (the independent combinations)
and solving with the Cholesky factor of M = Q R Qᵀ, which is fixed. For r in
the column space of C this is exactly rᵀ C⁺ r, and the normalisation is
½ log pdet C = ½ (log det M + log det Q D Qᵀ).
