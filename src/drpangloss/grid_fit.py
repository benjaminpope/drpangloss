"""Grid searches over model parameters.

Grids are built with ``indexing="ij"``: every output has one axis per grid
key, in the order of ``samples_dict``. For ``{"dra", "ddec", ...}`` axis 0 is
``dra`` (East offset) and axis 1 is ``ddec`` (North offset), so 2D maps need
a transpose to be shown as images with North up;
[`plot_grid_map`][drpangloss.plotting.plot_grid_map] handles this.

The functions that optimize a flux at every grid position find it as the one
key whose last part is ``flux`` (``flux``, ``comp.flux``, ...), unless
``flux_param`` says otherwise. Fluxes are relative to the primary (at flux
1), so for a companion the flux is its companion/primary flux ratio; see
[`drpangloss.limits`][drpangloss.limits] for converting to contrast or Δmag.
Contrast limits (Ruffio, Absil) are in [`drpangloss.limits`][drpangloss.limits].
