# state, so memory per point grows with the number of model visibilities
# (measured on CPU: ~25 bytes per visibility for a float32 likelihood grid,
# up to ~450 for a float64 flux optimization of a three-component System).
# By default a batch holds about BATCH_VISIBILITIES model visibilities
# (~0.5 GB in that worst case), and never fewer than MIN_BATCH_SIZE points,
# the earlier fixed default, so large data use as little memory as before.
# On an M4 CPU, warm grid times stop improving at ~1e6 visibilities per
# batch; small data such as 24 baselines run 2-4x faster than at 256
# points, because each batch is a loop iteration with fixed overheads. The
