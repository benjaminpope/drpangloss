We have focused on flexibility and ease of development, so if you have a project you want to use drpangloss for, but it currently does not have the required capabilities, don't hesitate to email me and we can discuss how to implement and merge it!

In Voltaire's Candide, Dr Pangloss' belief that we live in the best of all possible worlds is a satire of Leibniz' theodicy. But we do live in a world with Jax, so that if we can't optimize the world, at least we can optimize our fits to VLTI data.  </p>"}]}
