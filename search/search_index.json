Installation pangloss is hosted on PyPI (though this is currently a placeholder): the easiest way to install this is with pip install pangloss You can also build from source. To do so, clone the git repo, enter the directory, and run pip install . We encourage the creation of a virtual enironment to run pangloss to prevent software conflicts as we keep the software up to date with the lastest version of the core packages. Use & Documentation Documentation will be found here , though this is currently a placeholder. Collaboration & Development We are always looking to collaborate and further develop this software! We have focused on flexibility and ease of development, so if you have a project you want to use pangloss for, but it currently does not have the required capabilities, don't hesitate to email me and we can discuss how to implement and merge it! Similarly you can take a look at the CONTRIBUTING.md file. Name Why is it called pangloss? The leading optical interferometry model fitting code is CANDID . In Voltaire's Candide , Dr Pangloss' belief that we live in the best of all possible worlds is a satire of Leibniz' theodicy. But we do live in a world with Jax, so that if we can't optimize the world, at least we can optimize our fits to VLTI data.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#pangloss","text":"the best of all possible interferometry models Contributors: Dori Blakely, Benjamin Pope","title":"pangloss"},{"location":"#what-is-pangloss","text":"pangloss is a package for modelling optical interferometry data in Jax.","title":"What is pangloss?"},{"location":"#installation","text":"pangloss is hosted on PyPI (though this is currently a placeholder): the easiest way to install this is with pip install pangloss You can also build from source.
