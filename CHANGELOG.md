# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here, in the style of
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The project follows
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), with the usual caveat that
anything before 1.0 may change between minor versions.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Simulation.** `virgil.simulate.simulate(scene, template)` observes a scene
  with a template's sampling, errors and times (each sample at its own time
  for a moving scene, with `shift_days` to move the epochs), and
  `bias_test` fits a model to many noise draws to show biases and spreads.

- **Times and frames.** `OIData` keeps each sample's time (`mjd`, stored as
  `dt` days since a float64 `t_ref`) and exposure (`frame`) from OIFITS, and
  dict input may give `mjd` and `frame`. A frame is the baselines that
  closure phases tie together; by default all its samples get the frame's
  mean time (`read_oifits(frame_mjd="row")` keeps each row's).
  `OIData.epochs(gap_days=0.5)` labels nights, and `split_by_epoch()` returns
  one `OIData` per night. This is the groundwork for orbits and per-frame
  calibration terms.
- **Orbits.** `KeplerOrbit` (period, time of periastron, eccentricity,
  inclination, the secondary's ω, the receding node's Ω, angular semimajor
  axis) gives the secondary's `relative` position and exact
  `relative_velocity` in virgil's sky conventions, and `ThieleInnesOrbit` the
  linear form used for starting orbits, with converters between them and to
  jaxoplanet, which solves Kepler's equation (the new `[orbits]` extra).
  `PositionData` holds measured positions with their covariances (or
  separations and position angles), and `starting_orbits` finds good
  starting orbits for them by an exact Thiele–Innes least-squares solve on a
  grid of period, eccentricity and time of periastron.
- **Scenes that move.** `SourceModel.at(mjd)` gives a model at a time, and
  `Attached(component, orbit, anchor, bind, offsets)` places a component on a
  binary's orbit and binds its angles to the binary frame (line of centres,
  line of nodes, inclination, the side facing the primary). `OIData.model`
  evaluates a time-dependent model at each sample's own time; static models
  keep their fast path.
- **A model per dataset in sampling.** `numpyro_model`, like `fit`, accepts
  a model function returning a list of models, one per dataset, sharing
  parameters (e.g. a binary at several epochs with one flux ratio).
  Regularisers act on the first model.

## 0.2.0 (not yet released)

### Renamed: drpangloss is now virgil

- The import package is `virgil` (`import virgil`) and the PyPI distribution
  is `virgil-astro` (`pip install virgil-astro`). `pip install virgil` installs
  an unrelated package.
- The GitHub repository is `benjaminpope/virgil` and the docs are at
  <https://benjaminpope.github.io/virgil/>.
- A final `drpangloss` 0.2.0 on PyPI will depend on `virgil-astro` and forward
  to it, with a `FutureWarning` on import. Replace `import drpangloss` with
  `import virgil` and `drpangloss.x` with `virgil.x`; nothing else was renamed.
- There is no `nufft` extra: the NUFFT backend was removed (see below).

### Changed: closure phases (every four-telescope chi-squared changes)

- Closure phases of triangles that share a baseline are correlated. For four or
  more telescopes, `virgil` now keeps only the independent combinations of the
  closure phases of each frame and channel (three of the four triangles for
  four telescopes) and whitens them with the covariance of Kammerer et al.
  (2020, A&A 644, A110): the reported errors on the diagonal and correlations
  of +/-1/3 between triangles that share a baseline. Before, all triangles were
  treated as independent, which counted the closure phases 4/3 times for four
  telescopes.
- As a result every chi-squared, likelihood, evidence, grid and fit that uses
  four or more telescopes changes, and the number of closure phases in the
  likelihood (`OIData.n_independent`) is smaller than the number stored.
  Three-telescope data (e.g. JWST/NIRISS AMI with a single triangle per
  frame) are unchanged. Numbers from earlier versions, including some logged in
  the design notes, are marked "pre-6.0" and have not been re-measured.
- Unprojected closure phases enter the likelihood as the chord 2 sin(delta/2)
  over sigma (a von Mises likelihood for independent phases), which is
  smooth across +/-pi.

### Added

- **Readers.** `read_oifits(insname=...)` selects an instrument's tables. A
  GRAVITY file holding both fringe-tracker (FT) and science (SC) tables must
  be read with `insname=`: the two are never merged. `PHITYP` is checked, so a
  differential VISPHI is never read as an absolute phase. Closure phases are
  matched to visibilities of the same exposure, within twice the longest
  `INT_TIME`, since GRAVITY's pipeline averages different frames for each
  table (before, 50 of 136 reads of archival GRAVITY files failed).
- **Image reconstruction.** An `Image` component (a pixel map in a `System`,
  with an exact DFT, and an exact matrix Fourier transform on the uv lattices of
  AMIGO DISCO data), `fit` (Levenberg-Marquardt, L-BFGS or Adam, in float64 by
  default), the regularisers `MaxEntropy`, `TSV`, `TV` and `Centroid`,
  `l_curve` with corner, discrepancy and classic MaxEnt weights,
  `GaussianField` Gaussian-process pixels, `log_evidence`, `error_scale`
  (MacKay's re-estimate of the error bars), `dirty_image`, `beam`,
  `convolve_beam`, `diagnose`, and a Gauss-Newton mass matrix for NUTS. See
  the imaging tutorials in the docs.
- **Synthetic data.** `virgil.coverage` (`ami_grid_record`, `nrm_oidata`,
  `vlti_oidata`, `mask_transfer`) and `virgil.scenes` for simulations and tests.
- **Chromatic scenes.** Wavelength-dependent fluxes (`PowerLaw`, `BlackBody`)
  following SPARCO, a `Resolved` background, and multi-channel and multi-file
  `OIData`.
- **Source models.** Composable components and `System`, explicit `flux`
  parameters, `FlaredDisk` (Blakely et al.), `ModulatedGaussianRim`,
  `UniformDisk`, `EllipticalGaussian` and `GaussianArc`, an anisotropic
  `GaussianField`, fitted error inflation (`noise=`), the rapid-rotator
  `GravityDarkenedStar` (ported from Shashank Dholakia's ELR model, grey and
  chromatic), and an interface to harmonix for spotted stars.
- **Packaging.** Bessel functions now come from the separate `jaxbessel`
  package. Releases are published to PyPI from GitHub releases.

### Fixed and improved

- One likelihood (`likelihood.whitened_residuals`) for fitting, grids, limits
  and sampling, with normalised Gaussian log-likelihoods.
- The image coordinate convention (East left, North up, position angle North
  to East) is applied everywhere, including a position-angle bug in
  `BinaryModelAngular` and the orientation of plots.
- Maximum-entropy L-BFGS fits no longer collapse onto a few pixels, and
  stalled image fits are capped.
- Solvers and curvature functions compile once rather than on every call, grid
  tools size their batches by data size, and the test suite is faster.

### Fixed after the October 2026 codebase review

- The rim's non-negativity check (`ModulatedGaussianRim`, `is_physical`) no
  longer passes negative brightness when the top azimuthal order is zero.
- Independent phases use the exact von Mises normaliser, so fitted phase
  errors are no longer biased at large sigma (a true 1.8 rad used to fit as
  1.3 rad). Small-sigma likelihoods are unchanged.
- Converting V^2 to amplitudes or log-amplitudes floors the data at their own
  error, so points near or below zero no longer get enormous or tiny errors.
- Levenberg-Marquardt and L-BFGS in float32 converge instead of running to
  `max_steps`: the gradient tolerance is floored at sqrt(eps) of the starting
  gradient.
- `laplace_cov` and `fisher` compute in float64, like `fit`.
- `error_scale` solves MacKay's self-consistent equation instead of
  evaluating it at beta = 1; `log_evidence`, `error_scale` and
  `classic_maxent` accept a `FitResult` and refuse fits with fitted noise
  terms or per-dataset model lists, which they cannot handle.
- Index arrays cached under one x64 mode no longer break the other on JAX
  0.10 (closure-phase noise and the gravity-darkened star mesh).
- Corrected citations: MacKay (1992) eq. 4.10; classic MaxEnt is Gull (1989)
  with Skilling (1989).
- `virgil.__version__`; true minimum dependency versions (`jax>=0.8`), tested
  in CI; pandas, ChainConsumer and astroquery moved to the `plots` and
  `legacy` extras; CI on macOS with Python 3.11, Python 3.13, the lowest
  versions, and a wheel build.

### Removed

- The experimental NUFFT backend (`backend="nufft"`, the `nufft` extra): on a
  GPU it was slower than the DFT. Its code is in the history of PR #71.
- `amigo.simulated_disco_record`, replaced by `coverage.ami_grid_record`.
- Before the first release, these names were removed from the public API:
  `GaussianDiskModel` (use `System(star=PointSource(), disk=GaussianDisk(...))`),
  `cvis_gaussian_disk`, `cvis_binary_angular` (now private),
  `loglike_nosignal`, `fisher_matrix` and `observed_information` (use
  `fisher` and `inference.hessian_matrix`), `plotting.plot_trace_panels`,
  `plotting.plot_recovery_residuals`, the `legacy.savefits` module and
  `legacy.oifits_implaneia.load_oifits`.
- `Tabulated` and `load_oi_data` are no longer top-level names: they are
  `virgil.spectra.Tabulated` (provisional, to be replaced) and
  `virgil.amigo.load_oi_data`. `pixel_offsets` and `HarmonixModel` are new
  top-level names.
- The unused `termcolor` dependency and `sampling` extra, and the unused
  `data/chi2_ppf*.npy` tables.
