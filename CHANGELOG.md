# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here, in the style of
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The project follows
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), with the usual caveat that
anything before 1.0 may change between minor versions.

## Unreleased / in review

A codebase review in October 2026 found a set of correctness, documentation
and performance problems. The fixes are in review and will be listed here as
they merge:

- correctness fixes found by the review;
- corrections to docstrings, references, design notes and contributor docs;
- performance work.

Changes to the GRAVITY reader (matching OI_VIS and OI_FLUX exposures) are part
of the correctness fixes.

## 0.2.0 (not yet released)

### Renamed: drpangloss is now virgil

- The import package is `virgil` (`import virgil`) and the PyPI distribution
  is `virgil-astro` (`pip install virgil-astro`). `pip install virgil` installs
  an unrelated package.
- The GitHub repository is `benjaminpope/virgil` and the docs are at
  <https://benjaminpope.github.io/virgil/>.
- A final `drpangloss` 0.2.0 on PyPI will depend on `virgil-astro` and forward
  to it, with a `FutureWarning` on import. Replace `import drpangloss` with
  `import virgil` and `drpangloss.x` with `virgil.x`; nothing else was renamed.
- There is no `nufft` extra: the NUFFT backend was removed (see below).

### Changed: closure phases (every four-telescope chi-squared changes)

- Closure phases of triangles that share a baseline are correlated. For four or
  more telescopes, `virgil` now keeps only the independent combinations of the
  closure phases of each frame and channel (three of the four triangles for
  four telescopes) and whitens them with the covariance of Kammerer et al.
  (2020, A&A 644, A110): the reported errors on the diagonal and correlations
  of +/-1/3 between triangles that share a baseline. Before, all triangles were
  treated as independent, which counted the closure phases 4/3 times for four
  telescopes.
- As a result every chi-squared, likelihood, evidence, grid and fit that uses
  four or more telescopes changes, and the number of closure phases in the
  likelihood (`OIData.n_independent`) is smaller than the number stored.
  Three-telescope data (e.g. JWST/NIRISS AMI with a single triangle per
  frame) are unchanged. Numbers from earlier versions, including some logged in
  the design notes, are marked "pre-6.0" and have not been re-measured.
- Unprojected closure phases enter the likelihood as the chord 2 sin(delta/2)
  over sigma (a von Mises likelihood for independent phases), which is
  smooth across +/-pi.

### Added

- **Readers.** `read_oifits(insname=...)` selects an instrument table, and the
  GRAVITY fringe-tracker (FT) and science (SC) tables are never merged
  silently: FT data are skipped. `PHITYP` is checked, so a differential VISPHI
  is never read as an absolute phase. (The reader matches the exposures of
  GRAVITY tables; that part is in review, see above.)
- **Image reconstruction.** An `Image` component (a pixel map in a `System`,
  with an exact DFT, and an exact matrix Fourier transform on the uv lattices of
  AMIGO DISCO data), `fit` (Levenberg-Marquardt, L-BFGS or Adam, in float64 by
  default), the regularisers `MaxEntropy`, `TSV`, `TV` and `Centroid`,
  `l_curve` with corner, discrepancy and classic MaxEnt weights,
  `GaussianField` Gaussian-process pixels, `log_evidence`, `error_scale`
  (MacKay's re-estimate of the error bars), `dirty_image`, `beam`,
  `convolve_beam`, `diagnose`, and a Gauss-Newton mass matrix for NUTS. See
  the imaging tutorials in the docs.
- **Synthetic data.** `virgil.coverage` (`ami_grid_record`, `nrm_oidata`,
  `vlti_oidata`, `mask_transfer`) and `virgil.scenes` for simulations and tests.
- **Chromatic scenes.** Wavelength-dependent fluxes (`PowerLaw`, `BlackBody`)
  following SPARCO, a `Resolved` background, and multi-channel and multi-file
  `OIData`.
- **Source models.** Composable components and `System`, explicit `flux`
  parameters, `FlaredDisk` (Blakely et al.), `ModulatedGaussianRim`,
  `UniformDisk`, `EllipticalGaussian` and `GaussianArc`, an anisotropic
  `GaussianField`, fitted error inflation (`noise=`), the rapid-rotator
  `GravityDarkenedStar` (ported from Shashank Dholakia's ELR model, grey and
  chromatic), and an interface to harmonix for spotted stars.
- **Packaging.** Bessel functions now come from the separate `jaxbessel`
  package. Releases are published to PyPI from GitHub releases.

### Fixed and improved

- One likelihood (`likelihood.whitened_residuals`) for fitting, grids, limits
  and sampling, with normalised Gaussian log-likelihoods.
- The image coordinate convention (East left, North up, position angle North
  to East) is applied everywhere, including a position-angle bug in
  `BinaryModelAngular` and the orientation of plots.
- Maximum-entropy L-BFGS fits no longer collapse onto a few pixels, and
  stalled image fits are capped.
- Solvers and curvature functions compile once rather than on every call, grid
  tools size their batches by data size, and the test suite is faster.

### Removed

- The experimental NUFFT backend (`backend="nufft"`, the `nufft` extra): on a
  GPU it was slower than the DFT. Its code is in the history of PR #71.
- `amigo.simulated_disco_record`, replaced by `coverage.ami_grid_record`.
